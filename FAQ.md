<b>000webhost is started detecting it:</b><br>
This is because a lot of people are using grayfish. Thats why its files signature came in to their database. So probably they don't allow phishing experiments.<br><br>

It isn't detecting untill now. Because we don't allow their user agents to see phish page.<br>
So may be link is shared a lot times or may be domain name is already banned.<br>
